- [COVID Shield Diagnosis Server](https://github.com/CovidShield/backend)


### Running
#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CovidShield/portal.git
```

#### 2. Setup local environment

There are several environment variables you can set to configure the application.

To configure these:
1. Copy `config/local_env.yml.sample` to `config/local_env.yml`
1. Open `config/local_env.yml` and edit the values as needed

The available variables you can configure are:
* `DATABASE_HOST` - The host the MySQL server is running on (defaults to `localhost`)
* `DATABASE_USER` - The user MySQL is configured with for acces (defaults to `root`)
* `DATABASE_PASSWORD` - The password for the MySQL user (defaults to blank)
* `KEY_CLAIM_HOST` - The host the COVID Shield server is running on
* `KEY_CLAIM_TOKEN` - The token the COVID Shield server is configured to use

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
yarn install
```

#### 4. Create and set up the database

Run the following commands to create and set up the development database.

```ruby
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

#### 5. Start the Rails server

You can start the rails server using the command given below replacing the `KEY_CLAIM_HOST` to match the URL of your running diagnosis server config and the `KEY_CLAIM_TOKEN` to match the token it is running with.

```ruby
bundle exec rails server
```

And now you can visit the portal with the URL http://localhost:3000

The default username and password is `admin@covidshield.app` and `password`.
